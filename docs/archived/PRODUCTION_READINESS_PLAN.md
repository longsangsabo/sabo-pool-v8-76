## Phase 2: Deployment Strategy

### A. Phased Rollout Plan

#### Stage 1: Canary Deployment (10% traffic)
**Duration**: 24 hours
**Monitoring Thresholds**:
- Error rate < 0.1%
- P95 response time < 2s
- User satisfaction > 95%

**Success Criteria**:
- No critical bugs
- Performance metrics within targets
- User feedback positive

#### Stage 2: Expanded Rollout (30% traffic)
**Duration**: 48 hours
**Additional Monitoring**:
- Database performance
- Cache hit rates
- API response times

#### Stage 3: Full Deployment (100% traffic)
**Duration**: 72 hours monitoring
**Final Validation**:
- All systems stable
- Performance targets met
- User metrics positive

### B. Database Migration Strategy

#### Safe Migration Approach
1. **Index Additions**
   ```sql
   -- Create indexes concurrently
   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_tournaments_status ON tournaments(status);
   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_challenges_created_at ON challenges(created_at);
   ```

2. **Data Integrity Verification**
   - Pre-migration data validation
   - Post-migration integrity checks
   - Rollback data verification

3. **Backup Strategy**
   - Full database backup before migration
   - Point-in-time recovery capability
   - Data export for critical tables

### C. Feature Flags Implementation

#### Features Behind Flags
1. **New Tournament System** (`unified_tournaments`)
2. **Simplified Challenge Flow** (`unified_challenges`)
3. **Enhanced Profile Management** (`unified_profiles`)
4. **Admin Panel Optimizations** (`lazy_admin_loading`)

#### Gradual Enablement Plan
```javascript
// Feature flag configuration
const featureFlags = {
  unified_tournaments: { enabled: 0.1 }, // 10% rollout
  unified_challenges: { enabled: 0.3 },  // 30% rollout
  unified_profiles: { enabled: 0.5 },    // 50% rollout
  lazy_admin_loading: { enabled: 1.0 }   // 100% enabled
};
```
