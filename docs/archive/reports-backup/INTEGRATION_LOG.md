## 🔄 Path Alias Structure

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
resolve: {
  alias: {
    '@': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
    '@/features': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/features'),
    '@/core': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/core'),
    '@/shared': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/shared'),
    '@/hooks': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/hooks'),
    '@/integrations': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/integrations'),
    '@/pages': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/pages'),
    '@/assets': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/assets'),
  }
}
```

## 🧩 Import Best Practices

### ✅ DO: Use absolute imports with aliases
```tsx
import { AdminLayout } from '@/features/admin/components/AdminLayout';
import { useAuth } from '@/core/auth/hooks/useAuth';
import { Button } from '@/shared/components/ui/button';
```

### ❌ DON'T: Use relative imports across feature boundaries
```tsx
import { AdminLayout } from '../../features/admin/components/AdminLayout';
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

1. **State Management Optimization**
   - Implement Redux Toolkit for complex state
   - Create feature-specific stores
   - Enhance React Query integration

2. **Performance Improvements**
   - Add code splitting for large features
   - Implement React.lazy for route-based code splitting
   - Add memoization for expensive components

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Set up Jest with React Testing Library
   - Create E2E tests with Playwright
   - Implement visual regression testing

## 🏁 Conclusion

The integration of the three systems (Admin, Club, User) into a unified, feature-based architecture has been successfully completed. The new architecture provides a solid foundation for future development, with clear separation of concerns, improved maintainability, and enhanced developer experience.
