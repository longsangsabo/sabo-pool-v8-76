# Build Optimization Changes

## Chunking Configuration Changes

To fix initialization errors and React conflicts, we have made the following changes:

### ✅ All Manual Chunking Completely Disabled

We've completely disabled all manual chunking configurations to rely entirely on Vite's automatic chunking:

1. ❌ **Admin Chunking** - Disabled to fix 'ft' initialization errors
2. ❌ **Club Chunking** - Disabled to fix createContext errors
3. ❌ **Tournament Chunking** - Disabled to fix 'As' initialization errors
4. ❌ **User-core Chunking** - Disabled to ensure stability
5. ❌ **Vendor Chunking** - Disabled to avoid React conflicts
6. ❌ **Feature Chunking** - Disabled to prevent initialization errors

### ✅ Changes Made

1. Removed `manualChunks` configuration from `vite.config.ts`
2. Removed `manualChunks` configuration from `src/config/production.ts`
3. Removed `optimizeDeps` configuration from `vite.config.ts` to avoid React conflicts
4. Updated bundle optimization settings to use automatic chunking
5. Standardized on `esbuild` minifier instead of `terser` (which wasn't installed)
6. Updated TypeScript declarations in `src/vite-env.d.ts` to properly type Vite environment variables
7. Added error handling in production initialization to prevent errors

### ✅ Benefits

1. More reliable builds with no JavaScript initialization errors
2. No React conflicts between different chunks
3. Code is now bundled safely with Vite's automatic chunking
4. No more 'ft', 'createContext', or 'As' initialization errors
5. Better type safety with proper TypeScript declarations
6. Simplified build configuration for easier maintenance

## Test Results

✅ **Build Successful!**
The build completed successfully without any initialization errors. Vite's automatic chunking is working correctly, and all modules are properly loaded. The application is now ready for deployment.

## How to Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The build completes successfully without any initialization errors. The output shows that Vite's automatic chunking strategy works effectively, generating properly sized chunks for optimal loading performance.

## Netlify Deployment

When deploying to Netlify, use the following process to avoid husky installation errors:

### Option 1: Direct Netlify Deploy

Set the following environment variables in your Netlify settings:

- `SKIP_HUSKY` = `1`
- `CI` = `true`

### Option 2: Use Deployment Script

Run the deployment script which properly handles husky skipping:

```bash
./deploy-netlify.sh
```

### Troubleshooting Netlify Build Errors

If you encounter husky-related errors during Netlify deployment:

1. Verify `SKIP_HUSKY=1` is set in both `.env.production` and `netlify.toml`
2. Make sure the build command includes `SKIP_HUSKY=1` prefix
3. Check that the `prepare` script in `package.json` correctly handles the SKIP_HUSKY environment variable
