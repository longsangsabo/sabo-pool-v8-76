## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Build & Test
```bash
# Run full test suite
npm run test
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:coverage

# Build for production
npm run build

# Test production build locally
npm run preview
```

### 2. Environment Variables
```bash
# Production .env file
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key
VITE_VNPAY_MERCHANT_ID=your_production_merchant_id
VITE_VNPAY_SECRET_KEY=your_production_secret_key
VITE_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 3. Deploy to Platform

#### Vercel Deployment
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Verify deployment
vercel --prod --confirm
```

#### Netlify Deployment
```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist

# Or use automated deployment
git push origin main  # Triggers auto-deploy
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

#### Health Checks
```bash
# Check application health
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health

# Check database connectivity
curl https://your-domain.com/api/db/status

# Test payment endpoints
curl https://your-domain.com/api/payments/test
```

#### Performance Tests
```bash
# Run Lighthouse audit
npm run lighthouse

# Check Core Web Vitals
# - First Contentful Paint < 1.8s
# - Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5s  
# - Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1
```

## üìä Monitoring Setup

### Application Monitoring
```bash
# Install monitoring tools
npm install @sentry/react @sentry/vite-plugin

# Configure error tracking
# See monitoring configuration in src/utils/monitoring.ts
```

### Database Monitoring
- Supabase Dashboard: Monitor queries, connections
- Set up alerts for:
  - Connection pool exhaustion
  - Slow queries (>1s)
  - High error rates

### Payment Monitoring
- VNPAY Dashboard: Monitor transactions
- Set up alerts for:
  - Failed payments
  - Webhook failures
  - Refund issues

## üîí Security Checklist

### SSL & HTTPS

## üö® Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous deployment
vercel --prod --rollback

# Or for Netlify
netlify rollback
```

### Database Rollback
```bash
# Rollback database migrations if needed
supabase db reset --db-url=production_url
# Apply specific migration
supabase db push --db-url=production_url
```
