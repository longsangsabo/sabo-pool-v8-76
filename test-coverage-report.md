## Test Quality Analysis

For files that have tests, an analysis of test quality:

### Good Quality Tests (8)

These files have good test coverage with multiple test cases and assertions:

- src/utils/tournamentAdapter.ts
- src/components/common/Button.tsx
- src/components/common/Modal.tsx
- src/components/common/Spinner.tsx
- src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx
- src/hooks/useAuth.ts
- src/hooks/useForm.ts
- src/utils/formatUtils.ts

### Moderate Quality Tests (10)

| Source File | Test File | Notes | Improvement Suggestions |
| ----------- | --------- | ----- | ---------------------- |
| src/components/tournament/TournamentCard.tsx | src/components/tournament/TournamentCard.test.tsx | 2 test cases found. 3 assertions found. | Add more assertions. |
| src/components/tournament/TournamentFilter.tsx | src/components/tournament/TournamentFilter.test.tsx | 2 test cases found. 2 assertions found. | Add more assertions. |
| src/utils/dateUtils.ts | src/utils/dateUtils.test.ts | 3 test cases found. 3 assertions found. | Add more test cases. |

### Minimal Quality Tests (5)

| Source File | Test File | Notes | Improvement Suggestions |
| ----------- | --------- | ----- | ---------------------- |
| src/components/user/UserProfile.tsx | src/components/user/UserProfile.test.tsx | Only one test case found. Consider adding more test cases for better coverage. | Add more test cases. Add more assertions. |
| src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx | src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.test.tsx | Only one test case found. Consider adding more test cases for better coverage. | Add more test cases. Use React Testing Library. |

## Testing Strategy Recommendations

### Unit Testing

- **Components**: Use React Testing Library to test rendering, user interactions, and state updates
- **Hooks**: Use @testing-library/react-hooks to test custom hook behavior
- **Utils**: Use Jest to test utility functions with various inputs
- **Reducers**: Test all action types and state transitions

### Integration Testing

- Test component compositions and data flow between components
- Test form submissions and API interactions
- Test context providers with their consumers

### End-to-End Testing

- Consider adding Cypress or Playwright tests for critical user flows
- Focus on authentication, navigation, and key business logic

### Next Steps

1. Start by adding tests for uncovered components with high business value
2. Improve test quality for files with poor or minimal test coverage
3. Set up a coverage reporting tool for continuous monitoring
4. Consider implementing a test coverage threshold in CI/CD pipeline
