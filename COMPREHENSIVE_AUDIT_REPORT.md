## Recommendations

### Component Structure

1. Implement the component consolidation plan to standardize tournament card components
2. Start with removing any unused components identified in the report
3. Migrate components one by one, with thorough testing after each change

### Dependencies

1. Remove unused dependencies to reduce bundle size
2. Update outdated dependencies to fix security vulnerabilities
3. Set up automated dependency management with tools like Dependabot

### Performance

1. Implement memoization for components with frequent re-renders
2. Fix inline object and function creation in frequently rendered components
3. Consider code splitting and lazy loading for large components

### Security

1. Address high severity security issues immediately
2. Remove any hardcoded secrets and move them to environment variables
3. Fix unsafe React patterns like dangerouslySetInnerHTML

### Testing

1. Focus on adding tests for uncovered components with high business value
2. Improve test quality for files with poor or minimal test coverage
3. Set up a coverage reporting tool for continuous monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize issues based on severity and business impact
2. Create a roadmap for implementing the recommendations
3. Set up automated checks to prevent regression
4. Schedule regular audits to maintain code quality
