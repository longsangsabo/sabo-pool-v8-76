# Comprehensive Audit Scripts

This directory contains a set of lightweight audit scripts designed to analyze different aspects of your codebase and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.

## Available Scripts

1. **Component Consolidation Analyzer**
   - Script: `simple-component-consolidation.js`
   - Purpose: Identifies redundant tournament card components that can be consolidated into a unified component
   - Output: `tournament-card-consolidation-report.md`

2. **Dependency Analyzer**
   - Script: `simple-dependency-analyzer.js`
   - Purpose: Analyzes project dependencies to identify unused, outdated, and vulnerable packages
   - Output: `dependency-analysis-report.md`

3. **Performance Analyzer**
   - Script: `simple-performance-analyzer.js`
   - Purpose: Checks for common React performance issues like missing memo, large components, and excessive rerenders
   - Output: `performance-analysis-report.md`

4. **Security Analyzer**
   - Script: `simple-security-analyzer.js`
   - Purpose: Scans for security issues like hardcoded secrets, unsafe React patterns, and vulnerable dependencies
   - Output: `security-analysis-report.md`

5. **Test Coverage Analyzer**
   - Script: `simple-test-analyzer.js`
   - Purpose: Analyzes test coverage by finding components without tests and recommending testing strategies
   - Output: `test-coverage-report.md`

6. **Master Audit Orchestrator**
   - Script: `master-audit-orchestrator.js`
   - Purpose: Runs all individual analyzers and combines results into a comprehensive report
   - Output: `COMPREHENSIVE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`

## Usage

### Running Individual Scripts

To run any individual script:

```bash
node scripts/simple-performance-analyzer.js
```

### Running the Comprehensive Audit

To run all analysis scripts and generate a combined report:

```bash
node scripts/master-audit-orchestrator.js
```

## Output

Each script generates a Markdown report file in the root directory of the project. The master orchestrator will also create backups of all reports in an `audit-reports-backup` directory with timestamps.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: Scripts use only Node.js built-in modules and command-line tools available in most development environments
- **Actionable**: All reports include specific recommendations for addressing identified issues
- **Non-intrusive**: Analysis is read-only and will not modify your codebase
- **Comprehensive**: Covers multiple aspects of code quality from components to security

## Next Steps After Audit

1. Review the comprehensive report to understand the overall state of the codebase
2. Prioritize issues based on severity and business impact
3. Create tickets for addressing the most critical issues
4. Implement the recommended fixes
5. Re-run the audit to verify improvements
